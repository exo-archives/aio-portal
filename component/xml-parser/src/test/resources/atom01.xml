	  <content type="html"><p class="start"><span class="upper">July 1, 2006</span> marks the 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the start of the Battle of the Somme. (Not to be confused with the First and Second Battles of the Somme, which began on March 21, 1918 and August 21, 1918, respectively).</p> <p>What? You thought I was going to reference something else?</p> <p>Anyways, this post is actually a request for help in finding something. There was a film, called <span class="titles">The Battle of the Somme</span>, made by the official British cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, and I'd like to get my grubby little mitts on it.</p> <p>It's about 63 minutes long, consisting of actual footage of the battle, as well as staged enactments filmed before the start of the battle. It is, of course, in black and white, and is silent with title cards interspersed throughout.</p> <p>If IMDB and Amazon are to be believed, then a copy of it was still in production as recently as 1992 (although it appears to have only been as a PAL videocassette), and there are copies of a DVD titled <span class="titles">The Battle of the Somme</span> on eBay. However, these DVD listings are virtually information-free, and I'd rather not spend the money to purchase and ship one from the UK just to have it not be what I want (given that I can, last I checked, play Region 2 DVDs).</p> <p>So, what I'm looking for is information. Does anyone know if the film is still out there? If so, who makes it, what does the cover art look like? Or, alternatively, I'd also accept information on where I could acquire a digital copy of it. (Being a creation of the UK government prior to 1956, it is now considered in the public domain, and therefore could legally be downloaded.)</p> <p>Anyone?</p><p>(<a href="http://leftblank.org/archives/ramblings/2006/07/000554.shtml#comments">Comment on this entry</a>)</p></content>

	  <content type="html"><p class="start"><span class="upper">I'll admit it:</span> I don't get much personal mail. In fact, I'm not sure when the last time I had something in the mailbox that wasn't a bill, junk, or banking information was. As such, I tend not to check my mail that much, and just toss out the junk without reading it.</p> <p>Today, however, was different.</p> <p>Today, for some reason, I decided to check my mail despite having done so yesterday. There wasn't much: a bill, and a random junk card of some sort. I would have just tossed it, but the card caught my eye; on the front of it was a big, fairly nondescript painting of post-crucifixion <a href="/img/aryan_jesus.jpg" title="Aryan Jesus" rel="lightbox[lds]">Aryan Jesus emerging from the tomb</a>.</p> <p>&quot;Hrmm,&quot; I think, &quot;It would appear that the missionaries are out in force.&quot;</p> <p>Rather than searching for a large pot to boil them in if they came round again, I happened to flip the card over. A smaller version of the front picture, and stuff about faith in Christ, free video, &amp;c., &amp;c. Nothing exciting, but whilst looking at it I happen to spot a bunch of them laid out on the ledge next to the mailbox, and they had different images on the front: <a href="/img/creepy_family.jpg" title="Creepy Family" rel="lightbox[lds]">so-happy-they're-creepy-looking family</a>, <a href="/img/building.jpg" title="Temple?" rel="lightbox[lds]">building at night</a>, and bunch of <a href="/img/majesty.jpg" title="MAJESTY!" rel="lightbox[lds]">people shielding their faces</a> from a human silhouette floating in the sky surrounded by <em>extra</em> majesty.</p> <p>&quot;Well,&quot; I say, &quot;They have different stuff on the front, so maybe they have different stuff on the back.&quot; So, I go and take a look.</p> <p>The creepy family just has stuff about loving families and a free video. The building's just text about &quot;What is the purpose of life?&quot; and so forth. The floating majesty dude though, oh, that one's the keeper.</p> <p>Now, I should explain a bit: I'm not a huge fan of religion. It's never done anything for me, and we've since worked out an agreement: I keep my distance from it (mostly), and it keeps its distance from me (mostly). However, there are two religions that I <em>do</em> have a particular love for. One involves people who believe in an alien warlord held prisoner in a cage powered by an eternal battery (bwha?), and basically reads like something created by a bad sci-fi author. (Huh. <a href="http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Hubbard, Lafayette Ronald.html">Now why might that be?</a>) The other involves people who believe in an angel with the terribly unfortunate name of Moroni.</p> <p>I flip the card over, and I find out that it's <a href="http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Smith, Joseph.html">the latter.</a></p> <p>&quot;The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,&quot; it exclaims in big bold letters. I chuckle slightly, and then notice the print below the picture of the book: &quot;<i>Please accept a free copy as our gift.</i> <b>Call 888-537-2200</b>&quot;</p> <p>It's kind of a poor way to end this entry, but all I have to say is that I wish I had a PO box to have a copy sent to. (Hey, I don't exactly want <em>more</em> unsolicited mail from Mormons.) I certainly could use a good laugh.</p><p>(<a href="http://leftblank.org/archives/ramblings/2006/06/000551.shtml#comments">Comment on this entry</a>)</p></content>
