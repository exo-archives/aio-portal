this is some plain text
<table><tr><td>I love to write entities like < or > to see how the renderer interprets that
check the line break around this line
here we check the wellformdness of the HTML stuff because we enter a code section
which must terminates any open HTML tag
[b]bold[/b]
[i]italic[/i]

the next line is a quote of myself which contains code
[quote=julien]
[code]
this is an XML sample, so the great than etc... should be displayed instead of
being treated as entities
<?xml version="1.0"?>
[b]<root>[/b] the root element is bold
</root>
[/code]

the code is closed, we are going to test the nested quotes
[quote]
this is a nested quote
[/quote]
the next line is code that contains no breaks
[code]public static void[/code]
[/quote]

next one is a quote with no line break
[quote]quote with no line break[/quote]


we are going to test if the renderer closes the unclosed statements
[b][i][u]bold, italic, underline[/b]
