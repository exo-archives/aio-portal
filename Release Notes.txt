2. HOW TO SET UP EXO PORTAL
---------------------------------------------------
eXo Portal requires the Java 2 Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit version 5.x

2.1. Install Java SE 1.5 (Java Development Kit)
Based on JavaEE, our Portal runs currently fine with version 1.5 so if you are using newer version, please download and install this 
version to make Portal works fine. We will support newer version of Java very soon.

2.2. Download eXo Enterprise Content Management version from: http://forge.objectweb.org/projects/exoplatform/

2.3. Unzip that package under a path that does not contain any space (in Windows).

2.4. Open a shell session and go to the bin/ directory that has just been extracted.

2.5. Then run the command :
	Windows:
		eXo.bat run
	Linux, Unix, Mac OS
	chmod u+x *.sh ./eXo run

2.6. Open your web browsers, now eXo Portal can run on FireFox 2 or newer, Internet Explorer 6 or newer 
(we recommend using FireFox 3+ or Internet Explorer 7+ for the best result) 
and navigate to URL: http://localhost:8080/portal

2.7. When the page has been loaded, click "Login" on the top right corner. Specify the username "root" and the password "exo".
